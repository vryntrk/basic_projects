GENRE
Endless Runner & Arcade

SUMMARY
On the highway, people might be impatient. In Maganda Sim's universe, you are that impatient driver. Test your reflexes against approaching obstacles. Obstacles could be broken cars or slow drivers. Who knows? Plus, your score is based on survival time. Meaning, the sharpest reflexes can set the record. So, are you in?

HIGHLIGHTS
Appropriate Lane System: Obstacles don't just appear randomly. They follow a lane logic.
High-tempo Gameplay: The game gets harder in direct proportion to the elapsed time.
Infinite Loop: The road never ends unless you crash. (Trust me, it's harder than you think.)
