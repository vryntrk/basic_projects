SUMMARY
On the highway, people might be impatient. In Maganda Sim's universe, you are that impatient driver. Test your reflexes against approaching obstacles. Obstacles could be broken cars or slow drivers. Who knows? Plus, your score is based on survival time. Meaning, the sharpest reflexes can set the record. So, are you in?

Sliding Road: More realistic experience.
Speedometer: You can see your speed on the right-top corner.
