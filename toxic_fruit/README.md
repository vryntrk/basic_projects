GENRE
High-stakes Arcade & Survival Strategy

SUMMARY
You are the King's former food taster. Once you made a mistake and the King fell ill. Then, he punished you. They gave you apple, pear, banana and only 3 doses of antidote. Now, you are sitting at the table. If you can eat 5 apples, 5 pears and 5 bananas they will forgive you. The King has some mercy, so he will give you an extra dose of antidote when you complete a 5-fruit streak. Do not forget that one of the fruits might be poisonous and if you eat poisonous one your streak will start from zero. In short, your life is in your hands. Can you save your life?

HIGHLIGHTS
Resource Management: You have to eat 15 fruits, but you have just 3 doses of antidotes. So, you must be lucky when you are deciding which fruit to eat.
Short Time Interval: You have to eat a fruit in 5 seconds, or you die. Also, if you are poisoned you have just 1 second to drink the antidote, or you die.
Eating Lock System: You cannot eat fruit while being poisoned.
Russian Roulette Mechanics: Every turn, poisonous fruit is randomly selected. Also, some turns all fruits might be safe.
Dynamic Poisonous Fruit Ratio: At the beginning, poisonous fruit ratio is 75%. As you consume the fruits the ratio changes.
The King's Mercy: In a 5-fruit streak you will get an extra antidote.

WARNING
The number of fruits that should be eaten does not change if the bitten fruit is poisonous.
